# MERN Stack Admin Dashboard

This project is a MERN Stack Admin Dashboard application that allows businesses to monitor and manage their operations by providing key data about their products, customers, and transactions. The application utilizes the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js) to provide a responsive and user-friendly interface that can be accessed from any device with an internet connection.

The dashboard includes a variety of features, such as the ability to view daily and monthly transactions, monitor customer behavior, and analyze product sales. The data is displayed using interactive charts and tables, which can be customized to fit the user's specific needs. Additionally, the application includes advanced filtering options, allowing users to drill down into specific data sets to gain more detailed insights.

On the backend, the application utilizes MongoDB as its database, which allows for efficient storage and retrieval of large datasets. The frontend is built using React and Material UI, providing a modern and intuitive user interface. The application also makes use of Redux Toolkit and Redux Toolkit Query for state management and efficient data fetching.

Overall, this MERN Stack Admin Dashboard application is a powerful tool for businesses of all sizes looking to gain insights into their operations and make data-driven decisions. The Project covers both frontend and backend development, including:
